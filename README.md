# NixOS

Hello! Welcome to my personal NixOS configuration!
This is where I (attempt to) fully declare my laptop, and possibly other machines depending on when you're reading this.

## Notes!

Thus far, your user will be named "ilay".
Sorry about that, this configuration wasn't really meant for other people!

## Usage

```sh
$ git clone git@github:teesh3rt/nixos-again
$ cd nixos-again
$ sudo nixos-rebuild boot --flake . # just in case
```
